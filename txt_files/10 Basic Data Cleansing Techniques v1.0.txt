Q1: How to split text into lines?
A1: Sublime Text has several methods

Method 1: Small scale, precise
1) Highlight the first space
2) Ctrl+D and repeat until all selected
3) Enter


Method 2: Larger scale, minimal complexity, all at once

1) Highlight the first space
2) Alt+F3 (Select all occurrences of the current selection)
3) Enter


Method 3: Larger scale, minimal complexity, all at once using a Regular Expression

1) Ctrl + H (Replace)
2) Alt + R (Enable the Regular Expression match) 
3) Replace all on " " to "\n"


Method 4: Very large scale, significant complexity
Use T-SQL and a table valued function

SELECT *
  FROM dbo.udtvf_split_string('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit');

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15598584/how-can-i-select-every-other-line-with-multiple-cursors-in-sublime-text/16273692#16273692

1) Find: Ctrl+F
2) If regular expressions are not already enabled, enable them: Alt+R
3) Type in the expression 
Every second line (.*(\n|$)){2}
Every tenth line (.*(\n|$)){10}
4) Find all: Alt+Enter
5) Press left arrow to get rid of the selections, leaving just the cursors: ←
6) You now have a cursor at the start of every odd-numbered line. If you wanted even-numbered lines, press down: ↓



Q4: How to remove certain types of characters from text?
A4: It depends on scale and complexity

Smaller scale and minimal complexity: Sublime Text and a regular expression

Generate random strings:
http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/random-string-generator/

1) Replace: Ctrl+H
2) If regular expressions are not already enabled, enable them: Alt+R
3) Type in the expression

Remove all non-alphanumeric characters and keep spaces
[^A-Za-z0-9 ]

Remove all non-alpha characters and keep spaces
[^A-Za-z ]

Remove all non-numeric characters and keep spaces
[^0-9 ]

Larger scale and more complexity: T-SQL
SELECT dbo.udf_strip_non_alpha ('GYq7<0sMj&"Rn9fhSxnfWpAN/"202u@gTQao>?r UwT\Cv#a!R');
SELECT dbo.udf_strip_non_alpha_numeric ('GYq7<0sMj&"Rn9fhSxnfWpAN/"202u@gTQao>?r UwT\Cv#a!R');
SELECT dbo.udf_strip_non_alpha_numeric_keep_spaces ('GYq7<0sMj&"Rn9fhSxnfWpAN/"202u@gTQao>?r UwT\Cv#a!R');
SELECT dbo.udf_strip_non_numeric ('GYq7<0sMj&"Rn9fhSxnfWpAN/"202u@gTQao>?r UwT\Cv#a!R');
