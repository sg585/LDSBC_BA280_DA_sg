1d. MD shown listed in two regions, but the map highlight shows MD part of NE and not in MS as listed
2. dbo.avocado table contains a mix of granularity for city/state/region 
3. A reference table 'Loc_Reference' created to indicate YN for region 
3a. Reference table was updated for lat long locations using Google maps where the dots were located on the board report and where the city was centered
3b. Where the city/state was more than one location, a Google maps distance line was drawn between the locations and a midpoint pin was used for the lat long
3c. A related 'default' state was listed for each 'region' in the dbo.avocado table using the location selected for the lat long
3d. The total US location was listed in the center of the continental states
4.Default City and State added to reference table 'Loc_Reference'
